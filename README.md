# ML-Challenge
TKA Development is a team of builders who value creativity, teamwork, and a positive attitude. We believe that technical skill is important, but we don't judge people based on their background or appearance. We welcome all kinds of builders, creators, and designers, and we're particularly excited to invite developers to take on our open-ended challenge.

At TKA, we're less interested in your formal qualifications than in your ability to create amazing products and learn quickly. If you're up for the challenge, we encourage you to clone our repository and start building! Once you're ready, submit a pull request and our whole team will review your work. We can't wait to see what you create!

## Instructions
### 1. Learn
- Feel free to learn from any resources. here are a few resources that can help you to get started:

## Getting Started
- Clone the challenge repository
- Create a dedicated branch
- Write your code
- Commit your changes
- Fork the challenge repository
- Issue a Pull Request
- Notify us. Please send an email to [admin@tka.co.id](mailto:admin@tka.co.id)

## Suggestions
- get familiar with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). you can use the note book right away by trying it on your browser.
- Make it easy for us to try your app. Add instructions on how to run your demo. There's a section below where you can fill in.
- Don't be afraid if you're still a newbie. We will judge what you built adjusted with your experience. If you're just starting out, but can learn fast. We want you :)
- Be prepared to explain your decisions and your thought process in the next interview. We're curious about how you think! :)
